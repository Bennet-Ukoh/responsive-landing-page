      Project Objective:
      Design and develop a responsive landing page for a fictional product—GreenTech - Sustainable Solutions—using HTML and CSS (no JavaScript).
      The page should be visually appealing, mobile-friendly, and structured with proper semantic HTML to offer a great user experience.

      Use Case:
      An environmentally conscious user or potential investor visits the landing page to quickly understand the value proposition of GreenTech.
      They are greeted by a compelling hero section that introduces the product, explore the features section which highlights eco-friendliness, innovative design,
      and reliable service, and then view the footer for essential contact details. This page serves as a marketing tool that informs and engages the target audience.
