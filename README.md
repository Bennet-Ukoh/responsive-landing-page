## Use Case

**Primary Audience:** Environmentally conscious consumers, potential investors, and business partners.

**Scenario:**  
When a user visits the landing page, they are greeted by a hero section that introduces GreenTech with a compelling headline, subheadline, and call-to-action button. The features section highlights three key benefits (eco-friendliness, innovative design, and reliable service) in a responsive three-column layout that adapts seamlessly to smaller screens.
